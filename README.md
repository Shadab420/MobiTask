a) Open the apk file. It will take us to the home page.

c)  If we press create task it will take necessary info about a task and then stores it in the database
     with date of creation.

d) If we press List of task, it will take us to the list of available task in the database which is scrollbar
    enabled.

f) Pressing the delete button will show a popup to ask if we really want to delete the selected task or not
   and there is two button “yes” and “no”.
